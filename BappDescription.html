<p>What the extension does</p>

<p>It reads the whole Burp Proxy History, and extract all the headers from
requests and responses.</p>

<p>It shows what headers exist for every Host and Endpoint (URL). Clicking
on any entry gives more information about the headers of that request and
response pair.</p>

<p>There are predefined lists that the user can expand at will, to include
different types of headers and the vulnerabilities associated with them
(missing security headers, cookies missing security flags, verbose or
potentially dangerous headers, etc). This extension will identify every
type of vulnerability associated with headers that the user chooses to
include (with checkboxes in a configuration window).</p>

<p>A Microsoft Word report is automatically generated with all the findings,
including all the remediation and vulnerability information, the
occurrences where these headers appear (or are missing in case of missing
security headers), including host and endpoint.</p>

<p>For full functionality for this extension, please ensure you have Python3 installed on your machine.</p>
