TE&&The transfer encodings the user agent is willing to accept: the same values as for the response header field Transfer-Encoding can be used, plus the "trailers" value (related to the "chunked" transfer method) to notify the server it expects to receive additional fields in the trailer after the last, zero-sized, chunk.Only trailers is supported in HTTP/2.&&TE: trailers, deflate&& &&
Trailer&&The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer coding.&&Trailer: Max-Forwards&& &&
Transfer-Encoding&&The form of encoding used to safely transfer the entity to the user. Currently defined methods are: chunked, compress, deflate, gzip, identity. Must not be used with HTTP/2.&&Transfer-Encoding: chunked&& && 
User-Agent&&The user agent string of the user agent.&&User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0&& &&

X-Requested-With&&Mainly used to identify Ajax requests (most JavaScript frameworks send this field with value of XMLHttpRequest); also identifies Android apps using WebView&&X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest && &&
DNT&&Requests a web application to disable their tracking of a user. This is Mozilla's version of the X-Do-Not-Track header field (since Firefox 4.0 Beta 11). Safari and IE9 also have support for this field. &&DNT: 1 (Do Not Track Enabled), DNT: 0 (Do Not Track Disabled) && &&
X-Forwarded-For&&A de facto standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. Superseded by Forwarded header.&&X-Forwarded-For: client1, proxy1, proxy2; X-Forwarded-For: 129.78.138.66, 129.78.64.103 && &&
X-Forwarded-Host&&A de facto standard for identifying the original host requested by the client in the Host HTTP request header, since the host name and/or port of the reverse proxy (load balancer) may differ from the origin server handling the request. Superseded by Forwarded header.&&X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org:8080; X-Forwarded-Host: en.wikipedia.org && &&
X-Forwarded-Proto&&A de facto standard for identifying the originating protocol of an HTTP request, since a reverse proxy (or a load balancer) may communicate with a web server using HTTP even if the request to the reverse proxy is HTTPS. An alternative form of the header (X-ProxyUser-Ip) is used by Google clients talking to Google servers. Superseded by Forwarded header.&&X-Forwarded-Proto: https && &&
